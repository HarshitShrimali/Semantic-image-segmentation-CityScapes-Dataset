# Semantic-image-segmentation-CityScapes-Dataset
Performed semantic image segmentation using CityScapes Dataset

1. To identify and categorize every object in the image using semantic segmentation.
2. Used PSP-Net (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) using Tensorflow and U-Net using Pytorch to perform the task
3. Evaluate both models and got better results using U-Net.
